# RAPTOR
RAPTOR is a proof of concept, which shows that all data can be extracted from ReviewManager files. Partly, it also shows that these data can be cleaned. Its output is a XML file which can be queried e.g. in Excel.

Above, you find a spreadsheet with all queried bias data, extracted from 224 systematic reviews using RAPTOR.
