        "> *Schmidt, L., Shokraneh, F., Steinhausen, K., Adams, CE. Introducing RAPTOR: RevMan Parsing Tool for Reviewers. Syst Rev 8, 151 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1186/s13643-019-1070-0*\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In comparison to the old tool, DR-RAPTOR focuses on diagnostic data (not interventional!), its coded in Python and available via this online notebook. The old tool is a true dinosaur, running on Java 1.7 on desktop....  \n",
        "\n",
        "### Directions of use for DR-RAPTOR:\n",
        "\n",
        "Please create your own runnable copy of this Python Notebook in order to run the tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the tool by clicking the button in the top left corner of the cell below this text field (appears on hover, next to the 'SHOW CODE' text).\n",
        "\n",
        "Click on 'Choose Files' button that will appear within or on the bottom of the next cell.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch-select your .rm5 files (tool will only parse them if the file extension is **.rm5)**. \n",
        "\n",
        "Loading and parsing the data might take a few minutes, but during the process some information will appear. First, data will be uploaded, and this is the part where you might wait. The actual data extraction and parsing is super quick!\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool is optimised for **diagnostic accuracy systematic reviews and their associated data.** If you try and parse interventional reviews they you might not get a complete export, and statistical data will be missing. \n",
        "\n",
        "Upon completion the browser should offer 3 csv files for download, or it will download them directly, depending on browser settings. One file with basic review metadata and stats (title, doi, year of publication, year of last search, age of included studies ...). Alternatively, those .csv files should become available in the sidebar on the left, between or below the uploaded review files. \n",
        "\n",
        "The two other files will contain risk of bias data and numeric data from the included studies.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Caveat:** especially in terms of content there are two types of .rm5 files -> \n",
        "\n",
        "1. Complete data files supplied by Cochrane or single Cochrane groups which includes review text and full characteristics.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. The stats-only download .rm5 files that are accessible on the Cochrane Library next to review publications (note, in June 2021 there is a pop-up for a user to confirm they will only use RevMan to read these files). Stats only files are potentially preferable for quality because review-group-supplied files might have been changed after last publication and therefore could represent non-peer-reviewed content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The original RAPTOR, or DR-RAPTOR are not coded or designed to systematically extract results of meta-analyses or copyrighted text! The purpose is to extract study-based data for re-analysis or re-use in research contexts."
